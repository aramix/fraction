# Meteor ES6

Meteor Harmony is a thin wrapper around the [Traceur compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) by Google.

From the Traceur README:

> Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler that allows you to use features from the future today. Traceur's goal is to inform the design of [new JavaScript features](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures#array-comprehension) which are only valuable if they allow you to write better code. Traceur allows you to try out new and proposed language features today, helping you say what you mean in your code while informing the standards process.

When this package is added, every file ending with `.next.js` will be automaticaly compiled (with source maps) and bundled in the Meteor application.
