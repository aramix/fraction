Content aggregators deliver the latest news and act as a social hub for communities like [reddit](http://reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) – but they're fundamentally flawed in three ways:

1. **We can do better.** Why aren't content aggregators using the same technology behind services like Google and Netflix? Using a [collaborative filtering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering#Memory-based), Fraction can predict what you'll want to see better than the competition.

2. **Censorship is ██ing evil.** You should be able to decide what content you want to see; [people with money, authority, and bad intentions](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/) shouldn't be able to make that decision for you.

3. **Make it hackable.** We can customize [our text editor](https://atom.io/), why can't we customize our websites? You should be able to install third-party packages whenever you'd like, without being forced into a [bloated one-size-fits-all solution](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).
